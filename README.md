# Python-File-Crawler
SUMMARY: This is a script that helps you remove unwanted files in an entire directory (also called a folder). You simply tell it 'what folder', and 'what file'.
Then it copies the entire folder and subfolders without the unwanted files. I included an executable so you can run the script in any folder. 

WARNING! : Be careful where you run the script. Avoid placing it in system directories. 

Other than that ... it's a handy tool to help you clean up un-wanted files in an entire directory.

How to use:

0.) Copy/past the fileCleanup.exe in the directory where your target folder exists (i.e. the folder you want to clean up)

1.) Double click the fileCleanup.exe

2.) Enter the name of the folder you want to clean up with NO file extension
    for example:  "my_personal_file"
    
3.) Enter the type of file you want to clean up with NO " . " (the period is not necessary)
    for example: "mp4"
    
OR

1.) Navigate to the directory where "fileCleanup.py" exists
2.) Run it as a normal python script
    for example: "python fileCleanup.py"
